        <h2>Our Community</h2>
        <p>Members of the Python Togo community are open, considerate, and respectful. Behaviors that reinforce
            these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Being open.</strong> Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on
                projects, patches, problems, or otherwise.</li>
            <li><strong>Focusing on what is best for the community.</strong> We're respectful of the processes set
                forth in the community, and we work within them.</li>
            <li><strong>Acknowledging time and effort.</strong> We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that
                permeate the Python community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in
                mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.</li>
            <li><strong>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.</strong> We're receptive to
                constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute
                to the whole of our efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Showing empathy towards other community members.</strong> We're attentive in our
                communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Being considerate.</strong> Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other
                Python users.</li>
            <li><strong>Being respectful.</strong> We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their
                commitments, and their efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.</strong> When we disagree, we are courteous in
                raising our issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Using welcoming and inclusive language.</strong> We're accepting of all who wish to take
                part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make
                a difference.</li>
